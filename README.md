# lari
You've heard of siri? Well meet her not so quick brother lari

## lari is not that smart, but he can do some cool stuff. sort of.
Using your command line, you can input amazing things like:
```
node lari.js my-tweets
node lari.js movie-this ['Movie Name']
node lari.js spotify-this-song ['song name']
node lari.js do-what-it-says
```
and so much more! actually there isn't more, thats it. ONLY use commands above where you see [stuff] you can swap about 'stuff' to be whatever you like! Actually it has to be either a song or movie.

## Thanks!
Thanks for giving lari a chance.
